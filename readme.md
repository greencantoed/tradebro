# AEGIS v11 - A Cognitive Financial Advisor Engine

This project is a sophisticated, AI-powered financial trading assistant built with Python and the Google Gemini API. It uses a modular, tool-based architecture to perform a wide range of tasks, from data retrieval and quantitative analysis to sentiment analysis and self-reflection.

## Features

- **Modular Tool System:** 18+ tools for data sourcing, quantitative analysis, and cognitive tasks.
- **Dual-Mode Operation:** Switch between a fast "agile" mode and a rigorous, auditable "rigorous" mode.
- **Persistent Caching:** Uses DuckDB to cache market data locally, reducing API calls and improving speed.
- **Local Knowledge Base:** Includes a JSON-based knowledge base for core financial concepts (RAG).
- **Automated Learning:** Features a self-reflection protocol for the AI to critique and improve its own analysis.
