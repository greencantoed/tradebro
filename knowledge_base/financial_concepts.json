      "keywords": ["p/e", "pe ratio", "price-to-earnings", "valuation", "multiple"],
      "summary": "The P/E ratio is a valuation metric that compares a company's current share price to its per-share earnings.",
      "explanation": "A high P/E ratio could mean that a stock's price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. Conversely, a low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to earnings and possibly undervalued. It is most useful for comparing companies within the same industry.",

      "concept": "Sharpe Ratio",
      "keywords": ["sharpe ratio", "risk-adjusted return", "risk", "volatility"],
      "summary": "The Sharpe Ratio measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk.",
      "explanation": "It is calculated as (Return of Portfolio - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation of the Portfolio's Excess Return. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a better risk-adjusted return. Ratios above 2 are considered strong.",

      "concept": "Insider Transactions",
      "keywords": ["insider trading", "insider transactions", "ceo buying", "executive selling"],
      "summary": "Insider transactions are the buying or selling of a publicly traded company's stock by insiders (directors, officers, major shareholders).",
      "explanation": "Insider 'buys' are often viewed as a bullish signal as company insiders are optimistic about the stock. Insider 'sells' can occur for many reasons (diversification, personal finance) and are not always a bearish signal.",

      "concept": "Beta (Î²)",
      "keywords": ["beta", "volatility", "market risk", "systematic risk"],
      "summary": "Beta measures a stock's volatility relative to the overall market.",
      "explanation": "A stock with a beta greater than 1.0 is more volatile than the market; less than 1.0 is less volatile. A beta of 0.8 implies the stock is expected to be 20% less volatile than the market.",

      "keywords": ["yield curve", "inversion", "inverted yield curve", "recession indicator"],
      "summary": "A yield curve inversion occurs when long-term bond yields fall below short-term yields for bonds of the same credit quality.",
      "explanation": "This condition is widely regarded as a predictor of economic recessions because it signals investors expect weaker growth and lower interest rates in the future.",

      "keywords": ["sortino ratio", "downside risk", "risk-adjusted return"],
      "summary": "The Sortino Ratio measures risk-adjusted return focusing only on downside volatility.",
      "explanation": "It is calculated as (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Downside Deviation. Unlike the Sharpe Ratio, it penalizes only harmful volatility. Ratios above 2 are preferred for better downside risk-adjusted returns.",

      "explanation": "Calculated as Annual Return / Maximum Drawdown. Ratios above 2 indicate a good balance of returns and downside risk.",

      "concept": "Profit Factor",
      "keywords": ["profit factor", "trading performance"],
      "summary": "Profit Factor is the ratio of gross profits to gross losses in a trading strategy.",
      "explanation": "A Profit Factor above 1.75 suggests that a strategy is generating strong returns for each unit of loss incurred.",

      "keywords": ["maximum drawdown", "mdd", "peak-to-trough"],
      "summary": "Maximum drawdown measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in an investment's value.",
      "explanation": "Lower drawdowns (<15%) indicate better capital preservation, whereas drawdowns above 25% require higher risk tolerance.",

      "keywords": ["mean-variance", "modern portfolio theory", "optimization", "efficient frontier"],
      "summary": "A portfolio construction technique that selects asset weights to minimize risk for a given expected return.",
      "explanation": "Developed by Harry Markowitz, mean-variance optimization uses expected returns, standard deviations and the covariance matrix to compute weights that minimize portfolio volatility for a target return.",

      "concept": "Momentum Strategy",
      "keywords": ["momentum", "trend following", "moving average"],
      "summary": "A trading strategy that buys assets with upward price momentum and sells those with downward momentum.",
      "explanation": "Often implemented using moving averages (e.g., 50-day MA). When the price is above its moving average, the strategy goes long; when below, it exits or shorts.",

      "summary": "A strategy based on the idea that prices will revert to their long-term mean.",
      "explanation": "Bollinger Bands are often used: buy when price falls below the lower band, sell when it rises above the upper band. The strategy assumes extremes are temporary and prices will revert.",

      "summary": "A momentum strategy that buys when an asset is oversold and sells when it is overbought.",
      "explanation": "The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. Typical thresholds are 30 (oversold) and 70 (overbought). A simple RSI strategy buys when RSI < 30 and sells when RSI > 70.",

      "summary": "A process of selecting short and long moving average windows to maximise a performance metric.",
      "explanation": "By backtesting a range of moving average pairs (e.g., 10/20, 20/50, 50/200), a trader can identify which combination yields the best Sharpe or Sortino ratio. This tuning helps adapt the strategy to different market conditions.",

      "summary": "A portfolio allocation approach that equalizes risk across assets by weighting them inversely proportional to their volatility.",
      "explanation": "Each asset's weight is inversely proportional to its historical volatility. This ensures that each asset contributes the same level of risk to the overall portfolio, promoting diversification and risk balance.",

      "explanation": "The MACD line is the difference between a fast EMA (e.g., 12 days) and a slow EMA (e.g., 26 days). A signal line (e.g., 9-day EMA of the MACD) is used to trigger buy and sell signals: buy when the MACD crosses above the signal line, sell when it crosses below.",
