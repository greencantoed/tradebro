      "summary": "The P/E ratio is a valuation metric that compares a company's current share price to its per-share earnings.",
      "explanation": "A high P/E ratio could mean that a stock's price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. Conversely, a low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to earnings and possibly undervalued. It is most useful for comparing companies within the same industry.",

      "summary": "The Sharpe Ratio measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk.",
      "explanation": "It is calculated as (Return of Portfolio - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation of the Portfolio's Excess Return. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a better risk-adjusted return. A ratio > 2 is considered strong:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.",

      "summary": "Insider transactions are the buying or selling of a publicly traded company's stock by insiders (directors, officers, major shareholders).",
      "explanation": "Insider 'buys' are often viewed as a bullish signal as company insiders are optimistic about the stock. Insider 'sells' can occur for many reasons (diversification, personal finance) and are not always a bearish signal.",

      "explanation": "A stock with a beta greater than 1.0 is more volatile than the market; less than 1.0 is less volatile. A beta of 0.8 implies the stock is expected to be 20% less volatile than the market.",

      "explanation": "It is calculated as (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Downside Deviation. Unlike the Sharpe Ratio, it penalizes only harmful volatility. Ratios above 2 are preferred for better downside risk-adjusted returns:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.",
